# Custom_Chatbot
This project allows users to upload a document (PDF) and engage in conversational interaction with its contents using generative AI. Leveraging LangChain and HuggingFace embeddings, the system extracts, embeds, and semantically indexes the document, allowing users to ask context-aware questions. It is designed to simulate a personalized assistant that understands and recalls the details of conversation using LangChain memory.
Technologies Used:
Streamlit, Python, LangChain, PineCone, RAG
